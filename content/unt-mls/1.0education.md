# My Education

During my undergraduate experience of obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Chemistry at Henderson State University, I started employment at my local public library. Garland County Library, in my personal opinion, has the best environment I have been employed in. I am thrilled about the opportunity to make a career in libraries, and I hope to learn new skills in this Master's program to utilize in my professional career. I strive to be well-rounded, and I am eager to grow into being an effective library director as my career progresses. *originally written May 1, 2023*
