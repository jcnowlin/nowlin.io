# Reading Reflections of INFO 5600
## Reference professionals help disseminate accurate and reliable information to inquring users.
Information services in libraries serve the purpose of sharing information with inquiring
users. There are many ways users can acquire information, and a simple Google search may
satisfy their needs. Information professionals need to add a dose of customer service and
expertise to separate libraries from web-crawling search engines. RUSA (2004) provides
guidelines for reference providers to share information with users. There are similarities and
differences between in-person and remote reference services, but the core is competence and
customer service.
A reference librarian should be approachable, visible on campus or a prominently
displayed interface on a library’s website. One must show interest in the topic, effectively
conduct a reference interview in an easing way, communicate openly about search strategy, and
finally provide the answer satisfactorily. If a user needs more information, the interaction starts
over with the reference interview. Ultimately, a user should feel confident and satisfied in a
provided answer.

## Users deserve to feel comfortable seeking information from reference services.
A reference service user seeks information on a topic, and a surprising amount of factors
are in play when the reference interaction initiates. A user can be anyone, a working-class adult
from a rural background, an international student and a flagship university, or anyone who has
access to library services. Motivation for seeking information varies, and accounting for the
diversity of humanity is minimum to providing respect and dignity to everyone.
Knoff and Hobscheid (2021) emphasize inclusive experiences and share methods to
implement change while working towards a whole-policy revision. Among other details,
providing multiple ways to access information like video or audio, adjusting hiring practices to
enhance diversity within staff to convey better service to the userbase, and training reference
librarians to help users overcome marginalizing aspects of their background. Overall, empathy
should be a heavily featured tool in a reference librarian’s strategy.
Ethics are critical to reference services.
Ethics are a core part of the information services profession. Abiding by a standard set of
values can help one avoid pitfalls, but there are reported conflicting social ethical concerns
versus ethics of information service professionals. According to Deol and Kuar (2020), some of
these include accuracy of information, intellectual freedom, rising cost of information, copyright
infringement/fair use, and neglect of professional ethics. One should strive to comply with the
law, make sensible decisions about when to withhold information as a situation dictates, but
generally uphold intellectual freedom.

## Reference service users that achieve information literacy will better understand a discipline
and be enabled to become experts.
Users that become trained in reference service offerings, such as researching within a
database and evaluating authority, develop information literacy, a skill that seems to be
developed to varying degrees in members of the public. In a public library sense, a trained user
will be able to do their research to find the knowledge they need, and reference staff may be
freed up or minimally involved. This will enable reference staff to provide customer service to a
user that is unfamiliar with navigating information service offerings. ACRL (2015) provides a
framework for training students involved in higher education to think critically about
information. Six frames of reference are provided, including the construct of authority, the
process of information creation, value of information, research as inquiry, scholarship as
conversation, and finally strategic searching. Although this is geared towards higher education,
these frames may be relayed to a casual information seeker over time to better understand the
information they seek and the world around them.

## Leadership is responsible for workplace culture, and a positive workplace culture contributes
to better outcomes when serving users.
I am fortunate to be employed by a public library. Contrasting my library with other
employers, libraries have an honest mission, are still trusted by the public, and I personally am
in the best workplace I have been in. Martin (2020) notes the effect that leadership has on
library cultures, and it is an important factor. For personnel to achieve job satisfaction in which
they are immersed and energized by their work, the culture must allow for the workflow to
enable that. Development of a shared vision, open communication allows for staff input on
strategies, and competence demonstrated by leadership will enhance staff satisfaction and
trust.
