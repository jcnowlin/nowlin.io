I, James Nowlin, am the owner of [nowlin.io](https://nowlin.io). I run this website simply because I bought the domain *[nowlin.io](https://nowlin.io)* during 2020. This site, in its present state, will be used to share my written opinions about topics of varying relevance, my interests and hobbies, and anything else that suits me. My ePortfolio, a required project as part of the UNT MLS program, will be hosted here, too.

Employer

Education
----

I am currently halfway through the Master of Science in Library Science (MLS) program, general track, at University of North Texas. I am also one course away from completing the Advance Management of Libraries and Information Agencies Certification program at UNT. Find out more about the [MLS General Track](https://informationscience.unt.edu/ms-ls-general-program-study) and [Adv Mgmt Info Agencies Certification](https://informationscience.unt.edu/advanced-management-libraries). 

During my undergraduate experience, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Henderson State University in May, 2020. In addition to library work, I am experienced and competent laboratory technician, and I willingly admit that library work, and the education, are personally fulfilling. Especially when contrasted with chemistry.
