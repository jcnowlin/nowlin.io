 Welcome to nowlin.io v.3, created with Hugo!

nowlin.io has endured many iterations, similar to reincarnation, except although it was neutral in regards to good/evil, it was afflicted with tortuous rebirts. Here is a brief history of my website.

1. Domain bought via Google Domains in 2020, then launched via Google Sites.
2. Google Domains was bought by Salespace, per [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36352347), prompting me to switch to Cloudflare for domain registration and self-hosting for, well, hosting.
3. [nowlin.io](https://nowlin.io) v.1 continues, via a corrupt manner
- I backed up the Google Sites version of the site to Google Drive, then downloaded the whole cloud drive, then extracted the backed up site to my web root
- It worked well, aside from font rendering, and tedious effort to edit the site.
4. Installed Lektor, and used it to relaunch [nowlin.io](https://nowlin.io)
- It looked fine, but while I was researching how to use it, I discovered it has not been updated since 2018. *abandonware?*
5. Now I have installed Hugo, which seems like what Lektor is based off of, and it seems to be great! 

The purpose of [nowlin.io](https://nowlin.io) is to function as my personal website, host a blog you may view my written thoughts on my education, the public library landscape, the information profession, my personal interests, as well as other topics of varying degrees of relevance.

Bye forever!!
