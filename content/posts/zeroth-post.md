Welcome to [nowlin.io](https://nowlin.io)! This is the website of James Nowlin (me), Information Professional & Human Being. You'll find a variety of content here, including an About section describing my site and me, a personal blog which has no parameters for content, and my eFolio for UNT's MLS program. This page will evolve over time. Yee haw.
